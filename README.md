# PEERS: Peer Evaluation System

Productionization, Automated Testing, and CI/CD for the PEERS Peer Evaluation System

Date: 09/18/2026
Status: In Progress — Milestone 1 (Assessment & Planning)

A web-based platform for professors to manage peer evaluations in team-based courses: create and
manage student rosters, assign students to courses/teams, trigger email invitations, and receive
structured, professor-friendly reports with both numeric and textual feedback.

This capstone is a **continuation** of a previous KSU senior capstone project. The application
itself already exists (source: [`SameerHerm/ProjectPeerEvaluation`](https://github.com/SameerHerm/ProjectPeerEvaluation)).
This project's focus is **not new features** — it's transforming the inherited app into a
professionally engineered, production-ready product: automated testing, containerization,
deployment automation, and CI/CD.

---

## Objectives

- Assess the inherited application's architecture, tech stack, and existing test coverage
- Build a full automated testing pyramid: unit, integration, functional regression, and
  end-to-end tests
- Containerize the application (Docker/Docker Compose) and finalize a repeatable local dev setup
- Stand up a Continuous Integration pipeline (build, static analysis, tests, quality gates)
- Stand up a Continuous Delivery pipeline (staging deployment to Render.com, smoke tests) —
  production deployment remains a manual approval step, out of scope
- Maintain a Requirements Traceability Matrix linking business requirements to automated tests
- Document architecture, testing strategy, Docker setup, and release procedures

Explicitly **out of scope**: redesigning the UI, new application features, replacing the tech
stack, a commercial production hosting environment, or migrating databases.

---

## Deployment

**Render.com only** — this is the sponsor's explicit choice; other platforms (Vercel, Railway,
etc.) are not used for this project even though `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` documents them as
historical alternatives. Deployment is automated via the CI/CD pipeline in
`.github/workflows/` once merged to `main`; there is no separate staging environment beyond
what the pipeline provisions.

## Getting Started (For New Users)

### Prerequisites

1. **Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)** — LTS version; npm is included.
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)**
3. A code editor, e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dgobin-ksu/ProjectPeerEvaluation.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (installs both frontend and backend)
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
3. **Configure environment variables** — copy `src/backend/.env.example` to `src/backend/.env`
   and fill in `MONGODB_URI` and SMTP settings.
4. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Access the app**
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start both frontend and backend servers simultaneously
- `npm run setup` — install dependencies for both frontend and backend
- `npm run start:backend` / `npm run start:frontend` — start one side only
- `npm test` — frontend unit tests (Jest + React Testing Library)

Not yet on `main` as of this writing — merging soon from open PRs:
- `npm run test:e2e` — end-to-end tests (Playwright)
- `npm run test:backend` — backend unit tests

### Troubleshooting

- Missing dependencies: re-run `npm run setup`.
- Ports 3000/5000 in use: close conflicting apps or change the port in config.
- Email sending issues: check `src/backend/.env` SMTP settings.
